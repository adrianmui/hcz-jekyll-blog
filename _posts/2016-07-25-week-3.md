After a gruesome past week of algorithms and data structures, we were finally introduced to the world of web. <br>

During the week, we learned the following skills:

<ul>
  <li>Accessed data from the OpenWeather Api and Github Api </li>
  <li>Built a Webscraper and Displayed search results from Dice.com</li>
  <li>Worked with Sinatra to build game applications such as RockPaperScissors and Blackjack21</li>
  <li>Implemented our Dice.com Webscraper program with Sinatra</li> </ul>

  That said, it was really fun working with Sinatra. It really puts into perspective how real web applications work (through HTTP requests) as opposed to the script-like single thread programs ran through our Terminals(previous projects). We learned how valuable information are stored in cookies and sessions(big cookie), and exactly how annoying that is.

  Next week, we dive into the big boy version of Sinatra, otherwise known as Rails. I'm excited. It feels like we're finally ramping up and learning the skills required of a Web Developer. I'm excited to see what Rails has to offer and how exactly it differs from Sinatra. s

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
