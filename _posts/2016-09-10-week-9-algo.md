*Given an array NUMS of n integers, find three integers in NUMS such the sum is closest to a given number, target.*

*Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.*

Example: 

```ruby
  input: [-1,2,1,-4], 1
  output: 2
```

My initial thoughts were pretty simple: 
Loop over the elements of nums three times and save the closest value to target in a variable named close.


## Solution 1

```javascript

var threeSumClosest = function(nums, target) {
    var close = -1337;
    for (var i = 0; i < (nums.length - 2); i++){
        var a = nums[i];
        for (var j = (i + 1); j < (nums.length - 1); j++ ){
            var b = nums[j];
            for (var k = (j+1); k < (nums.length); k++){
                var c = nums[k];
                if (Math.abs(close - target) > Math.abs(a+b+c - target))
                {
                    close = a+b+c;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return close;
};
```

The solution is  in O(n^3), where n is number of elements in the array.


That said a better(and faster) solution can be done in O(n^2). Actually, Allan Gr√∏nlund and Seth Pettie beat that in 2014 by devising an algorithm in O(n^2/((nlog(n))^(2/3))) but we'll just ignore that for now :)

Better solution O(n^2)

+ Sort the array to avoid On^3
+ Set the first two elements of the sorted array as a and b. Then set the last element as c.

+ if the sum of first three elements are smaller than target, increase the index of b.

```

|    +- second                                   third

```

+ else, decrease the index of c.

|    +- second                                third
+-first
```

+ when b and c are adjacent indexes, a, b, and c resets with a and b moving over 1 indexes to the right.

## Solution 2

```javascript
var threeSumCloset2 = function(nums, target) {
  var arr = nums.sort();
  var close = nums[0]+nums[1]+nums[2];
  for (var i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
    first = i;
    second = i + 1;
    third = nums.length - 1;
    while (second < third) {
      var sum = nums[first] + nums[second] + nums[third];
      if (sum === target) { 
        return target;
      }
      if (Math.abs(target-sum) < Math.abs(target-close)) {
        close = sum;
      }
      if(sum > target) {
        third -= 1;
      } else {
        second += 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return close;
}
```
