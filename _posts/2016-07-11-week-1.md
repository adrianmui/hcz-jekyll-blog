Eat, sleep, and breath code.That’s what I’ve been doing since VCS officially started last Tuesday. It’s been a blast. I’ve learned so much. And there’s still so much more to learn!

In the past week, I learned what it means to program in OO. I learned how to properly structure parts of my code into separate objects and classes, and how to test them using a Ruby Gem(rspec) as well. I also learned that no matter how well you thought your code was written, it could always be written better.

I’m so excited for what Week 3 brings. To my understanding, we’ll be diving more deeply into testing and afterwards alghorithms & data structures.

In my spare time I will be starting a website/blog of my own where I will be able to showcase some code I’ll have worked on throughout the weeks. Look forward to it! Sloppy and messy code that is. Don’t worry, it will get better :)
