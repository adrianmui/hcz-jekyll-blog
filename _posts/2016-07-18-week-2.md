This week we cracked down the fundamentals of CS, Data-structures and the art of sorting and arranging data. We learned many basic algorithms, such as insertion, Bubble Merge, Selecting, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, etc. We also learned how to use Trees and Linked Lists.

Not my cup of tea, but definitely something necessary to learn for my future as a coder!
