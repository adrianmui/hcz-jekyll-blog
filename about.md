<h3>Hey, I'm Adrian.  </h3>

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer, redditor, and expert gamer. I mainly code with Ruby and work with the Ruby on Rails Framework. Most of all, I like making stuff that works! I believe in a healthy medium that connects users(intuitive interface) with an intelligent backend. I was previously enrolled in the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in Engineering and CS, currently in the Viking Code School's 1000+ hour Immersive Software Engineering program. Loving every minute of it.
